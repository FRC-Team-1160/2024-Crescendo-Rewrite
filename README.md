# The Robot Code for Crescendo 2024... Refactored!

Trying out new ideas for next year.

## New Stuff

### Subsystem Manager

The subsystem manager class handles inter-subsystem logic and command priority.

### Real and simulated subclasses

Subsystem classes are now divided into RealIO and SimIO subclasses that both inherit from an abstract main class.

### Javadocs

Documentation (and more comments), yay!
